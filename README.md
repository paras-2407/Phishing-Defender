# Phishing Defenderüõ°Ô∏è
Phishing Defender is a Python-based project that aims to protect users from phishing attacksüö´ by analyzing links on a webpage. The project utilizes web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup to extract links from a given webpage. These extracted links are then sent to a new page, where a machine learning modelüß† predicts whether each link is phishing or legitimate based on various parameters.


## Features
- Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to extract links from a webpage.  
- Integration with a machine learning model to predict the phishing or legitimate status of each link.  
- Output display of links along with their corresponding status on a separate window.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 
- Beautiful Soup
- Flask (for the web application)
- Machine learning model dependencies (ensure you follow the model setup instructions)
- Any Code Editor (VS Code, Pycharm)


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/varunpareek690/phishing-defender.git
cd phishing-defender
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Follow the instructions in the model/README.md to train or set up the machine learning model.
