# HACK2.0
In this project we created a phishing alert solution that will help the existing tech users to find out which link is of phishing and which is legitimate
For the project we used HTML, Web Scrapping, JavaScript, Flask, Extension, Python libraries  such as requests, BeautifulSoul and Pandas.
It was our first time in any hackathon, so it was difficult for us to make extensions and doing web scrapping. For that we first learned about all the concepts toughly.
